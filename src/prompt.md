# Crypto Trading Platform Requirements

## Overview
A React-based web application for cryptocurrency trading utilizing Alpaca for trading execution and Polygon.io for market data.

## GitHub & Version Control Best Practices

### Repository Setup
- Initialize with a comprehensive .gitignore file
- Include detailed README.md with setup instructions
- Set up branch protection rules for main/master branch
- Enforce pull request reviews before merging

### Security & Sensitive Data
- NEVER commit API keys, secrets, or credentials to the repository
- Use .env files for local development
- Add .env to .gitignore
- Provide .env.example template with dummy values
- Use environment variables in production
- Consider using GitHub Secrets for CI/CD pipelines

### Branching Strategy
- main/master: Production-ready code
- develop: Integration branch
- feature/*: New features
- bugfix/*: Bug fixes
- release/*: Release preparation
- hotfix/*: Production emergency fixes

### Commit Guidelines
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Follow conventional commits format
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers in commits

### Pull Request Process
- Create descriptive PR titles
- Use PR templates
- Include screenshots for UI changes
- Link related issues
- Require code review approval
- Ensure CI checks pass before merging

### Code Review Standards
- Review for security vulnerabilities
- Check for sensitive data exposure
- Verify proper error handling
- Ensure code meets style guidelines
- Review test coverage

### CI/CD Integration
- Set up GitHub Actions for:
  - Automated testing
  - Linting
  - Build verification
  - Security scanning
  - Dependency updates
